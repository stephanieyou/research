### Research Overview
I am working with [Leila Wehbe](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/){:target="_blank"},
Assistant Professor in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon
University.

The project aims to shed light on how different word embeddings represent
words and what information each word embedding captures by using a variety of
evaluation and comparison methods.

### Project Proposal
My project proposal is linked [here](./embedding-proposal.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
