#### Proposal
In my [proposal](/research/docs/proposal.pdf), I go over my proposed research project, 
describe my research goals for the coming semester, and list biweekly
milestones.

This is just the start of my computer science research journey! Next semester, 
when I take 15-400 Research Practicum in Computer Science, I will be updating 
this web page with my biweekly reports.

#### Project Overview
I am working with
[Leila Wehbe](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/){:target="_blank"}, Assistant
Professor in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University.

The project aims to shed light on how different word embeddings represent words
and what information each word embedding captures by using a variety of
evaluation and comparison tools.
