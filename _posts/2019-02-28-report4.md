#### Progress since Report 3
I resolved the runtime errors I got from using the open-source CCA library after
discussing the possible causes with Professor Wehbe. The issue was that I wasn't
providing enough sample data to the training method, which led to linear algebra
complications.

I have tried CCA on two different datasets:
1. 25-dimensional CBOW and Skip-Gram
2. 500-dimensional GloVe and Skip-Gram

All vectors were obtained from [this website](https://vsmlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/getting_vectors.html#pre-trained-vsms). The top 10,000 most common English
words can be found at [this Github repo](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt).

I extracted the vectors corresponding to the top 10,000 most common English
words (if it exists in the dataset), and trained the CCA module using them. Then
I used the validate method in the library to determine the prediction accuracy.
The prediction accuracy, plotted below, is very low on the training set itself,
so my next steps are to determine whether this is due to low correlation
between the embedding spaces or if it's actually a bug in either my code or the
library used.
