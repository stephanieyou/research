#### Progress since Report 2
I finally obtained access to the ML clusters (after creating an SCS account and
having a back and forth with SCS Help Desk).

I am currently working on doing canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on a set of
pretrained vectors I found [here](https://vsmlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/getting_vectors.html#pre-trained-vsms).

At first I tried using [scikit-learn's CCA method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_decomposition.CCA.html)
from its cross decomposition library, but I found articles online questioning
its accuracy. There also is not a lot of documentation online, and it apparently
isn't being maintained, so I switched to a different module, [pyrcca](https://github.com/gallantlab/pyrcca),
which is open-source and a little bit easier to use.

I'm in the process of debugging and figuring out how to use the library, but I
hope to get it working by this weekend.

#### Milestones reached
At this point, I have veered a little bit from the original milestone plan.
Rather than first choosing the word embeddings to use, I am trying to perform
initial analysis (CCA) on the most easily obtainable vectors. It's more of a 
hands-on approach, where the goal is to learn more about word embeddings and
their vector spaces by actually doing calculations with them and computing
preliminary analysis.
